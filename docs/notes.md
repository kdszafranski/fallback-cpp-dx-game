## Burn Down to Finish

- B power up does something
- SFX
    - game over
    - destroy block
    - power up over
- Music
- Button SFX (mouse enter)
- Create Demo Video
- Supply build/download for Win10
- Add to portfolio page 
- Add to resume

## IDEAS to take this further

## Fix Bugs
- [x] fix collisions
- [x] block should complete animation before being destroyed

## Architecture
- [ ] Winmain, winproc
- [ ] convert to be like the GCC book
- [ ] move large constructors to init methods
- [ ] Implement an IScreen interface
- [ ] make consistent style
- [ ] choose Vector standard
- [ ] WinRT and DX11

## Technical Challenges
- [ ] add event manager, implement Observer pattern: https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/observer.html
- [ ] convert to OpenGL
- [ ] convert to use SDL2
- [X] separate direction from speed
- [X] make level editor
- [X] added animation/process manager to handle multi-frame animations
- [ ] consider memory/profiling
- [ ] compile to web assem using Emscripten (open gl only)
- [ ] allow blocks of varying sizes

## Graphics
- [ ] custom cursor (resource)
- [x] screen shake on ball loss
- [x] delay between ball restart
- [x] ship explosion on game over
- [x] add more animations
- [x] ball trail
- [x] juicier, particles
- [x] clean up score UI
- [x] clean up balls remaining


## Audio
- [ ] better sfx
    - [ ] 
- [ ] add music
